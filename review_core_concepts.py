Subtask 1.1: Please write a brief explanation of the following statistical concepts in your own words:
Mean
Median
Standard Deviation
Correlation

My Answer:
Mean is calculated by sum up all values in a series and divide the summation to the count of the values in that series.
The Median is the middle value of a series in means of sorting.
Standard Deviation shows how deviate our values in a series from our mean value.
The relationship between series is important and may be positive or negative.
It shows whether increase a series while another series increases. We name it correlation.
Its value should be between -1 and 1.


Subtask 1.2: Choose a simple machine learning algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression) and explain how it works.

My Answer:
Linear Regression regress two parameters linearly.
It creates an equation like y = mx+n and determines the constants (m and n).
If your parameter count increases like 20-40 or sth. The linear equation going larger.
This will cause underfitting. Because it can not catch the nonlinear part of the data.
But it is so fast compared to neural networks or boosting algorithms.
